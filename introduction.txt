I'm Moin Khan, currently in my last year of Bachelor of Computer Application at Chandigarh University in Punjab. In my first semester, I saw a senior's project - a Netflix-like website. Back then, I was learning C language and didn't know much about web development. So, I turned to YouTube to learn more and found Masai School. They offered a full-stack web development program with lots of hands-on experience in both frontend and backend technologies. I completed various web projects, including frontend, backend, and APIs. This experience helped me learn and grow in the web development field.
As for my family, my father is a civil contractor, my mother is a housewife, my elder sister is pursuing her B.Ed degree, and my younger brother is studying in the 9th grade.
